## Purpose of this Fork

I need ARM-compatible Docker images as the standard AMD Docker images will not run on my node.

## What is Coti Db-App?

Coti Db-App is a component developed by Coti that synchronizes the blockchain state and transaction into a relational
DB. This service is a tool to support applications that require high speed search and aggregations over the network
state and data.
